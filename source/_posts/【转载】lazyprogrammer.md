lazy coder but great code!

{% endnote %}

A lazy programmer {% label warning @loves programming %} but {% label warning @hates working %}, so they work as little as possible.

A lazy programmer finds every possible way to {% label warning @avoid working %} on the weekends.

A lazy programmer writes a lot of {% label warning @tests %}, so QA people do not waste their time.

A lazy programmer {% label warning @documents %} their code, so that coworkers do not waste their time.

A lazy programmer is a {% label warning @master %} of delegation. After they delegated a task, they immediately forget about it.

A lazy programmer does not edit long files, they teach {% label warning @regular expressions %} how to edit the file in their place.

A lazy programmer does {% label warning @not deploy in production %}, they instruct Jenkins to do that. Therefore a lazy programmer is not afraid of deploying on Friday afternoon.

A lazy programmer goes to the office as little as possible, possibly when other non-lazy people are not around, so they don’t {% label warning @waste their time %}.

A lazy programmer knows {% label warning @the best tools of their trade %} so that they can reuse other people’s work as much as possible.

A lazy programmer is {% label warning @easygoing %}, because arguing about silly things is, well, silly and tiring.

A lazy programmer is super {% label warning @efficient %}, does in a few o %}f hours what would take many to others so that they can spend the rest of the day lingering on the couch feasting on Netflix.

A lazy programmer stares at the code for hours, trying to figure out the way to write {% label warning @as little code as possible %}.

A lazy programmer makes use of {% label warning @existing tools and services %}, so they can release earlier.

A lazy programmer uses the basic UI template the {% label warning @hosting service provides them %} and then they say it’s [brutalism](https://brutalist-web.design/).

At [Saasform](https://saasform.dev) we are lazy and we support lazy programmers to deliver great code fast and with little effort.
